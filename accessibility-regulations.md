# Accessibility regulations

## How to use these guidelines

The techniques detailed on this page follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Universities are legally required to comply with level AA.

These accessibility techniques benefit users with temporary or long-term disabilities. Techniques are inclusive of individuals with:
* visual impairment
* limited mobility
* hearing difficulties
* neurodiversity
* limitations due to ageing

We recommend testing sections of the website to ensure they meet accessibility standards.

## Consistency
The web platform used should have consistency as a high priority, a consistent website can help to begin the foundations of a good accessible platform. 

### Website consistency
The website should remain consistent, including navigation, coding standards and language.

Benefits:
* Promotes good consistency and standards
* Great for screen readers
* Good for international audiences

#### All websites follow coding standards, including third party plugins 
The web platform should have no major coding errors.

#### Languages
Every web page should have a default language assigned. If another language is present, list it alongside the default site language.

#### Control consistency
The position of navigation and controls should be consistent across the website. Components, buttons and elements of the website should be uniform. 
Visibility

Keyboard focus indicators (when tabbing through content) are clearly visible when active. 

The target size for pointer inputs (logos, buttons, icons) is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels. Although, we encourage that inputs are available by at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels to meet AAA standards.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:   
* 1.3.1 – Info and Relationships   
* 2.4.5 – Multiple Ways
* 2.4.11 – Focus Appearance (Minimum)
* 2.5.8 – Target Size (Minimum)
* 3.1.1 – Language of Page  
* 3.1.2 – Language of Parts
* 3.2.3 – Consistent Navigation
* 3.2.4 – Consistent Identification
* 4.1.1 – Parsing
* 4.1.2 – Name, Role, Value

### Content consistency

Website content must adhere to standards including navigation, structure and logical order.

Benefits:
* Improves the user experience for all users
* Great for screen readers
* Good for international audiences
* Structured and locatable
* Page content, structure and how content is related should be logical and consistent. Screen readers present information using a pages formatting and structure. It is key that the website's content is coherent in structure.

#### Locatable
Ensure that there are at least two ways to locate a webpage. Exceptions include receipt or confirmation pages.

#### Help and advice
Help (contact details, forms, live chat) should be provided in a consistent manner. For example, live chat functionality should be provided on all pages. A further example, contact fields should be consistent ie. phone number before email address.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 1.3.1 – Info and Relationships
* 1.3.2 – Meaningful Sequence
* 2.4.5 – Multiple Ways
* 3.2.6 – Consistent Help

## Make sure content is readable and predictable
Content is readable for all users. Consider how assistive technology accesses content. Content should be predictable so that the user understands the page and where links will lead.

### Website standards
The website must be a platform for promoting readability.

Benefits:
* A good foundation for an accessible website

#### Visuals
The content of the website should be viewable in either landscape or portrait view. The meaning and function of the web page should not degrade by switching orientation. Furthermore, the page should be viewable without horizontal scrolling.

If the user increases the size of text the page should remain functional and content visible up to a 200% resize. If the user changes the size of text, the content, function and meaning of the page is readable.

The text and background contrast ratiois at least 4.5:1. We recommend contemplating a contrast ratio of 7:1 to meet AAA standards. 

#### Triggers
The content of the website should be fully accessible by keyboard without unexpected triggers (alert, error etc.). We do not recommend such triggers. If unavoidable, triggers should be persistent to allow the user to view the content. They should also be hoverable and dismissable by both keyboard and mouse.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 1.3.4 – Orientation
* 1.4.3 – Contrast (Minimum)
* 1.4.6 – Contrast (Enhanced)
* 1.4.11 – Non-Text Contrast
* 1.4.4 – Resize Text
* 1.4.10 – Reflow
1.4.12 – Text Spacing
1.4.13 – Content on Hover or Focus

### Content standards

Content should be descriptive, seamless and predictable.

Benefits:
* Great for screen readers
* Improved user experience
* Helps users to quickly locate content

#### Descriptions
Every page should have a clear and descriptive title. 

Headings and form labels should be descriptive to aid users. Helpful to those with memory difficulties and effective for screen readers.

#### Ensure that links are descriptive
Well defined hyperlinks help users to understand the context of the link destination. Helpful to screen readers that have the functionality to list the available links on a page. Image links should be descriptive of the image and the destination. For example “an image of Joe Bloggs - view Joe's profile”. 

Try to keep linked text as short as possible whilst remaining descriptive. Avoid linking full URLs. 

Good example: A guide to Sheffield
Bad examples: Read more

A page that contains many links to the same destination must share the same description. 

#### Sensory considerations
Content should not rely solely on colour. For example, errors on a form presented in colour.

Content should not rely on sensory instruction. For example “click on the search bar on the right of the website”.

#### Media
No imagery of text.

All videos featured on the website must feature live captions, including live streaming. With live media, a possible solution could include auto-generated captions.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.4.2 – Page Titled
* 2.4.6 – Headings and Labels
* 1.4.5 – Images of Text
* 1.4.1 – Use of Colour
* 1.3.3 – Sensory Characteristics
* 1.2.4 – Captions (Live)
* 2.4.4 Link purpose (in context)
* 2.4.9 Link purpose (link only)

## Allow the user control
The user should have control of elements of the website and not be required to take steps to prevent intrusive items such as media, animation or repeated content.

Benefits:
* Reduces the likelihood of impaired functionality users

#### Media control

Audio should not automatically be played. 

No content flashes more than three times per second.

Time-specific events such as animations and holding messages can be troublesome. The user should be able to pause, delay or prevent a time-specific action from occurring. Exceptions include live streams or business critical time-limits. These could include time-restricted ticket sales.

#### Undeviating content
Provide a way for users to skip repeated blocks of content, such as a skip to content button

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 1.4.2 – Audio Control
* 2.2.1 – Timing Adjustable
* 2.2.2 – Pause, Stop, Hide
* 2.3.1 – Three Flashes or Below Threshold
* 2.4.1 – Bypass Blocks

---

## Provide alternatives
Provide alternative options for content including imagery, audio and video. Furthermore, be wary of motion and gesture-based functions.

#### Image alternatives
Alternative text provides a visual description of imagery for those  using accessibility tools. As search engines crawl alt text, a descriptive image could help with search results.

Benefits:
* Great for screen readers
* Beneficial to SEO (search engine optimisation)
* Improved user experience

Describe the content of the image succinctly, whilst being as descriptive as possible. Avoid descriptive prefixes such as “an image of”.

Good example: A student on campus eating a green apple   
Bad example: A student

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:   
* 1.1.1 Non-text Content

#### Video and audio alternatives
Video and audio-only pages are problematic to assistive technology. Including alternatives, such as a transcript is beneficial to all users. Assistive technology can read the transcript. It also allows the user an alternative for when playing audio or video isn't appropriate.

Benefits:
* Great for screen readers
* Beneficial to SEO (search engine optimisation)
* Improved user experience

Ensure that videos and audio material contain captions. Provide audio description or text transcript for videos with sound.

An audio description should be available to select for pre-recorded videos. This is currently not possible with Sitecore.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:    
* 1.2.1 – Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.2 – Captions (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.3 – Audio Description or Media Alternative (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.5 – Audio Description (Pre-recorded)

#### Motion and gesture
Pointer and gesture-based functionality is not recommended. When such functionality is present alternatives should be available.

Benefits:
* Provides alternatives for physical impairment
* Prevents accidental actions

An action requiring multiple gestures to complete should provide a single-click alternative. For example, zoom requires the user to pinch the screen, alternatively, the user can click a zoom in or out button.

On clicking an item, an action should only occur if the click ends inside the actionable area. If the user moves outside the area before releasing the click, the action should be cancelled.

An action requiring motion to operate allows the user to disable the motion. The user should be able to execute the action through an alternative interface.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.5.1 – Pointer Gestures
* 2.5.2 – Pointer Cancellation
* 2.5.4 – Motion Actuation
* 2.5.7 – Dragging Movements

---

## Keyboard functionality

Website functionality should be accessible and achievable with a keyboard. Moreover, timing should not be a requirement to function properly. For example, hold down the enter key for five seconds.

A good way to test this is to discard your mouse and attempt to navigate the website using your keyboard alone.

Benefits:
* Great for screen readers 

All content should be navigable via the keyboard so that the user is not trapped in a section. Where a page contains breaks, the user should be able to navigate to them to quickly access content.

Focus, where a user can tab between available items, is a common keyboard function. So, focus must be visible when used. The focus should be in a logical order to avoid any confusion. Furthermore, elements should not change on focus or when receiving input from the user.

#### Character shortcuts
We do not recommend character key shortcuts which can interfere with keyboard shortcuts. If unavoidable, they should allow the user to remap characters or disable them.


Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.1.1 – Keyboard
* 2.4.7 – Focus Visible
* 2.4.3 – Focus Order
* 3.2.1 – On Focus
* 3.2.2 – On Input
* 2.1.2 – No Keyboard Trap
* 2.1.4 – Character Key Shortcuts
* 2.4.13 – Page Break Navigation

---

## Ensure that forms are accessible
Forms can be particularly troublesome when poorly designed. Carefully consider the development of forms to aid the user as much as possible.

Benefits:
* Great for screen readers
* Improves data integrity

#### Label consistency
Labelling of items is key and should provide clear instruction on how to complete the form. Ensure labels, fields and components contain consistent descriptive text to aid the user.

#### Errors and data handling
Error handling should be scrutinised with particular attention to errors displayed. Errors should be easily identified when using a screen reader. The error message must appear as close to the error as possible with clear instructions on how to fix the issue.

Consider how to safeguard data to prevent user error. Particularly important on forms including legal commitment. A summary page may be required so that the user can check data before submission. Provide the user with options without jeopardising the functionality of the form. The handling of and deletion of data is equally important.

#### Auto-complete fields
To help users to programmatically complete fields, auto-complete options should active. Autocomplete values are essential to allow the user’s browser to prefill fields. Developers must specify the intention of input fields with “input type=”type”. 

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.5.3 Label in Name
* 3.3.1 Error Identification
* 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions
* 3.3.3 Error Suggestion
* 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

## Advanced accessibility
The advanced section covers AAA level standards. This level is not mandatory to University websites at present. Although, this does not mean that this level should be ignored. Survey where it is possible to involve as many techniques as possible.

### Media

#### Clear audio
Background noise is minimal and audio is clear to aid those with hearing impairments. The suggested levels are 20 decibels lower than the foreground noise.

#### Text transcripts, sign language and audio description
All media is accompanied by a text transcript. Live media includes a script, either generated auto-captions or a pre-prepared script.

Pre-recorded sign language and audio description provided for all videos.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 1.2.6 – Sign Language (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.7 – Extended Audio description (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.8 – Media Alternative (Pre-recorded)
* 1.2.9 – Audio Only (Live)
* 1.3.6 – Identify Purpose

### Visual

#### Images of text
Avoid images of text and ensure that quotes are text-based.

#### Contrast ratio
The contrast between background and foreground colour is at least 7:1.

#### Advanced visuals
Five features are required to pass:
* Users can select their preference of background and foreground colours
* Text blocks are no wider than 80 characters
* Text is not justified to both sides of the webpage
* Line spacing is at least a space-and-a-half within paragraphs. Paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than line spacing.

* 1.4.9 – Images of Text (No Exception)

### Controls
Keyboard function
All functions on the websites are accessible to keyboards with no exceptions.

#### Time-specific
There are no time-limits on the website, exceptions include live events such as an auction.

Interruptions are pausable, except for emergency messages. The user should be able to opt-in to updates rather than continue to receive alerts. There should be no automatic redirects or refreshing of the page.

#### Data and authentication
Data is held for a minimum of 20 hours before a timeout removes the data (e.g. shopping basket).

The user is able to re-authenticate elements of the websites (such as form inputs). Reducing the need to manually input credentials.

#### Motion and animation
Do not add anything that flashes more than 3 times per second to the website.

Do not use motion animation on the website. If unavoidable, ensure that the animation can be disabled.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.1.3 – Keyboard (No Exception)
* 2.2.3 – No Timing
* 2.2.4 – Interruptions
* 2.2.5 – Re-authenticating
* 2.2.6 – Timeouts

* 2.2.4 – Interruptions
* 2.2.5 – Re-authenticating
* 2.2.6 – Timeouts
* 2.3.2 – Three Flashes
* 2.3.3 – Animation from Interactions

### Promotes clarity

#### Link description
A page containing multiple links to a single destination must have the same description.

A page containing an image link describes the image and destination. For example “an image of Joe Bloggs - view blog”. 

#### User location
Provide clear locations. The user is able to identify where they are on the website and utilise options such as breadcrumbs. If in a process such as a multipage form, the user is able to easily find where they are in the process.

#### Content headings
Use headings for every new thought or topic on the web page. Ensure that the integrity of the copy is not marred by an unnecessary surplus of headings.

#### Focus indication
When a component receives keyboard focus:
* The focus indicator has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between focused and unfocused states
* The element within focus isn’t hidden
* The focus indicator area is at least 2 CSS pixels around the perimeter
* Ensure that the target areas for all pointer inputs (logos, buttons, icons) are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels
* There are no restrictions on modes of input. For example, if a user switches from mouse to keyboard. Exclusions can be made if the input is for security reasons.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 2.4.8 – Location
* 2.4.9 – Link Purpose (Link Only)
* 2.4.10 – Section Headings
* 2.4.12 – Focus Appearance (Enhanced)
* 2.5.5 – Target Size
* 2.5.6 – Concurrent Input Mechanisms

### Readable and understandable

#### Phrasing
Avoid using technical, figurative, idiomatic phrases or words. Where required, explain the context in brackets or link to a glossary of terms. 

Avoid using abbreviations. If unavoidable, list the full term alongside the abbreviation in brackets. Or, link to a glossary of abbreviations.

Avoid using words where pronunciation is key. Where required, add or link to a phonetic guide in brackets.

#### Reading age
Ensure that your content can be understood by a person with 7-9 years of schooling. Aids include adding summaries, diagrams and imagery. Also, structure content well with headings and sections.

#### Change on request
Provide an option to pause elements that automatically updates (e.g. a live news ticker). Resume of function should only happen when requested.

All links open in the same window, unless deemed essential. If a link does open in a new window, the user is aware of this (for example, in the anchor text of the link).

Forms do not auto-submit when fields are filled.

Any redirect from one page to another is immediate.

#### Ensure that elements of help, such as labels and fields, are succinct and accurate
Where an input field requires more information add a link for further detail. For example, "Help with this field".

Where a field needs a specific formatting, provide further detail. For example, "Date: DD/MM/YYYY".

#### Error prevention
To pass this guideline:
* All data input submissions are reversible
* All data input submissions are checked for input errors. The user is given a chance to correct any mistakes.
* Add a confirmation page that summarises the input and explains the outcome. Add an option to correct or discontinue. Finally, the page has a button or checkbox that acts as confirmation of the submission.

Relates to the following web content accessibility guidelines:
* 3.1.3 – Unusual Words
* 3.1.4 – Abbreviations
* 3.1.5 – Reading Level
* 3.1.6 – Pronunciation
* 3.2.5 – Change on Request
* 3.3.5 – Help
* 3.3.6 – Error Prevention (All)
