# About accessibility

We design for all of our users and start with their needs. All design output should solve a real user need in order to exist.

## Why is accessibility important?

**It benefits all**   
There is a misconception that accessibility is purely to benefit those with disabilities, when in fact good accessibility standards promote a good user experience for all. For example a straightforward design with a consistent and clear navigation benefits a range of disabilities, resulting in a website where information can be rapidly and efficiently located. A benefit to all users.     

**It is the law**   
UK universities are lawfully required to provide a website that is as accessible as possible. Websites must provide an accessibility statement that is kept up to date and features key information such as what is not accessible on the website, future plans and contact details.

## How can I learn more about accessibility?

Learning about accessibility can appear to be a mountain of a task, however, is much more manageable with key reading, dedication and hands on practice.

There are several websites we recommend:

1. [EDX free accessibility course](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)
2. [Silktide videos](https://silktide.com/accessibility/videos/) and [Silktide youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/silktide)
3. [Silktide free e-book](https://silktide.com/lp/free-ebook-accessibility-best-practices/)
4. [Wuhcag](https://www.wuhcag.com/) - Handy for simplifying the often complex regulations

## How can I ensure pages I am responsible for are of a good standard?

We have procured a website accessibility checker called Silktide, web editors can request access via the work request form on the [digital experience service](https://www.shu.ac.uk/digital-experience-service). Once accessed, the Silktide academy can teach you the fundamentals of using Silktide and live chat support is available on the platform.
