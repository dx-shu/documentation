# Accessibility documentation

We design for all of our users and start with their needs. All design output should solve a real user need in order to exist.

By regularly testing our assumptions with real end users of all physical and cognitive abilities, we ensure that all our design outputs are suitable for all users. We create design patterns that allow our content team to offer additional support to users who may need it, whether that be due to a visual impairment or simply because the content of a page is difficult to understand.
