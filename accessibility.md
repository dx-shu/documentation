# About accessibility

We design for all our users and start with their needs. All design output should solve a real user need in order to exist.

## Why is accessibility important?

### It benefits all

There is a misconception that accessibility is purely to benefit those with disabilities. In fact good accessibility standards promote a good user experience for all. A straightforward design with consistent and clear navigation benefits a range of disabilities.  Resulting in a website where information can be rapidly and efficiently located. A benefit to all users.

### It is the law

UK universities legally must provide a website that is as accessible as possible. Websites have to provide an accessibility statement that is  regularly updated. The statement features key information including what elements are not accessible.
